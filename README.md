# CSSBundle

This is currently a work in progress

CSSBundle will enable you to add your CSS files properly in your templates using "stylesheet" and "stylesheets" tags
It will
 * minify and merge your css file in a production environment
 * allow you to write your CSS file as twig templates, in order to manage variables in and write more clever CSS in a "LESS" fashion
 * adds CSS3 compatibility so that you don't have to write 4 different instruction for your border-radius and gradiant stuff
